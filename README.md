SkillSwap - A Skill Exchange Platform
SkillSwap is a front-end web application developed for the IST107 - Introduction to Internet Programming course. It simulates a community marketplace where users can offer their skills and trade them for other skills they want to learn, all without any financial transactions.

Features

Dynamic Marketplace: Browse a list of all available skills offered by the community.

Live Search & Filter: Instantly filter the skills by title, user, or category as you type.

Offer a Skill: Users can add their own skills to the marketplace via a simple form.

Data Persistence: New skills are saved to the browser's localStorage, so they are not lost when the page is reloaded. This simulates a database on the front-end.

Multi-Page Layout: A clean, multi-page structure with separate pages for the marketplace, user profile, messages, and offering a skill.
